# Student External Profile

This application serves like a Student Profile Showcase.

Each student must upload a `<your_full_name>.yml` file inside `/src/students/` with all his information. For example: [alejandro-sanchez.yml](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/student-external-profile/blob/master/src/students/example.yml).

The `yml` file must be filled with all your personal and professional information, after complating the YML fill the application will automatically generate a student portfolio like the following:

```
