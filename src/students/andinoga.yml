    summary: |
      My career until now has been choatic, fun and challenging. I have been able to learn from different companies how to become a 
      well rounded individual. My love of learning as pulled me into a different direction now to learn how to code, build websites and possibly change the world. 
      I have been able to adapt in very different positions, from managing a fast food resturant with over 75 employees, to handling over 100 
      catastrophe cases in different states and learning how to exercise empathy and now by learning how to write computer talk and be able to build from a dream to reality. 
      In the next 6 months I believe to acquire a junior developer position in a kick ass company.
